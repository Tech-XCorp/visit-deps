This folder contains CMakeCache.txt files for various libraries that can be
used as 'seeds' for a build on Windows.   This should help minimize the
process of configuring.

The default values chosen are those needed by VisIt.

Copy them to the appropriate build directory, and modify paths as necessary.  
In CMake-gui, 'Reload' Cache before selecting the generator, and the values
will be used.
