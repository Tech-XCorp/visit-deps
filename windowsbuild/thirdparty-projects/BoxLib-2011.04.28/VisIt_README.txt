BoxLib-2011.04.28-projects.zip contains projects for 
MSVC9 (2008) and MSVC 2010 and a copy of this readme.


Get BoxLib-2011.04.28.tar.gz from VisIt's third_party libs.
Extract it to the location on your computer where you
wish to build the third-party libs. (eg. "C:\")
This will create
C:\BoxLib-2011.04.28

Extract the boxlib projects to the new directory
C:\BoxLib-2011.04.28
to create
C:\BoxLib-2011.04.28\Windows

There will be two sub-directories in the Windows folder: 'MSVC90' and 'MSVC-2010'
Open the folder for the compiler you wish to use, and 
open the corresponding solution file.

Choose the platform (Win32 or x64), and use with VisIt, select the Release 
configuration and build.
